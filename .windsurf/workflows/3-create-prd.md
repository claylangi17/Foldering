description:  Get the AI to act as a product manager and define requirements for a new feature.
---

Act as an experienced Product Manager for the '[Your Project Name]' web application. We are planning to develop a new '[feature_name]' (e.g., 'Courses Overview Page', 'User Profile Management Dashboard').

Your task is to create a detailed Product Requirement Document (PRD) for this feature. This PRD should be saved as '[feature_name]_PRD.md'.

**Important:** Do NOT write any code yet. Your focus is solely on deep thinking and comprehensive requirement gathering. Please ensure the PRD leverages insights from the '[project_name]_architecture_analysis.md' document where relevant (e.g., existing user roles, tech stack constraints).

The PRD should include, but not be limited to, the following sections:

1.  **Introduction & Goals:**
    * Brief overview of the '[feature_name]'.
    * What problems does this feature solve for the user?
    * What are the primary business objectives for this feature?
2.  **Target Users/Personas:**
    * Reference existing personas from '[project_name]_architecture_analysis.md' if applicable.
    * Identify specific user types who will interact with this feature and their needs related to it.
3.  **User Stories:**
    * Provide a comprehensive list of user stories. Use the format: "As a [user persona], I want to [perform an action], so that I can [achieve a benefit]."
    * Cover various scenarios, including edge cases if apparent.
4.  **Functional Requirements:**
    * Detailed descriptions of what the system should do.
    * Break down the feature into specific functionalities (e.g., for a courses page: search, filter, sort, display course cards, pagination).
5.  **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    * **Performance:** (e.g., page load times, response times).
    * **Usability & Accessibility:** (e.g., WCAG compliance level, responsive design).
    * **Security:** (e.g., data protection, input validation, role-based access if applicable).
    * **Scalability:** (Considerations for future growth).
6.  **UI/UX Considerations (High-Level):**
    * Key user interface elements or interactions (no detailed design, just concepts).
    * Consistency with the existing application's look and feel.
7.  **Success Metrics:**
    * How will we measure the success of this feature post-launch? (e.g., engagement rate, task completion rate).
8.  **Out of Scope (Optional but Recommended):**
    * Clearly list any related functionalities that will NOT be part of this specific feature's initial implementation.

Please be thorough and detailed. This document will be the single source of truth for developing the '[feature_name]'.
