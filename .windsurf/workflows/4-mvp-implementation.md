description: Ask the AI to implement the PRD as an MVP, starting with static data.
---

Now, let's begin implementing the '[feature_name]' based on the specifications in '[feature_name]_PRD.md'.

Your task is to:
1.  **Act as a full-stack developer.**
2.  **Implement an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version** of the '[feature_name]'. Refer strictly to the functional requirements and user stories outlined in '[feature_name]_PRD.md' that are critical for a first functional version.
3.  **Initial Data Handling:** For this MVP, use **static/mock front-end data** for any dynamic content (e.g., lists of courses, user details). Do *not* implement database connections or backend API calls for data retrieval/persistence in this initial step unless explicitly part of the agreed MVP scope in the PRD. We will integrate with the actual database ([mention database type, e.g., Prisma with PostgreSQL] as per '[project_name]_architecture_analysis.md') in a subsequent phase.
4.  **Adherence to Existing Patterns:** Ensure the new code aligns with the coding patterns, styling conventions (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material UI), and architectural principles identified in the '[project_name]_architecture_analysis.md' document.
5.  **Outline Your Plan (Before Coding):** Before writing the code, please provide a brief outline of the files you plan to create or modify and the key components you will build. Wait for my approval before proceeding with the actual implementation.

Focus on creating a functional front-end that demonstrates the core user interactions.
