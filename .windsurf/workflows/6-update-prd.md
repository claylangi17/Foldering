Excellent work on the MVP for '[feature_name]'!

Now, please update the '[feature_name]_PRD.md' document by adding a new section at the end titled '## Implementation Status - [Current Date]'.

This section should comprehensively detail the current state of the feature's implementation based on the work just completed. Please include:

1.  **Summary of Changes Made:** Briefly describe the components and functionalities implemented in this iteration.
2.  **Completed Requirements:** List all functional requirements and user stories from the PRD that are now fully implemented and working as expected in the MVP. Reference them by their original numbering or description.
3.  **Partially Completed Requirements:** List requirements/stories that are partially implemented. For each, clearly state what has been done and what remains to be completed.
4.  **Pending Requirements (Next Steps for this Feature):** List all requirements/stories from the PRD that have not yet been started.
5.  **Known Issues or Limitations:** Document any bugs, limitations of the current MVP implementation (e.g., "uses mock data, no backend integration yet"), or deviations from the PRD.
6.  **AI's Suggested Next Steps for Development:** Based on the current status and the overall PRD, what do you recommend as the immediate next development tasks for this feature?

Ensure this status update is clear, accurate, and provides a good overview for anyone (human or AI) picking up work on this feature next. After you describe how you will modify the PRD, I will ask you to apply the changes.
